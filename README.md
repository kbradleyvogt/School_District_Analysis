# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview 
The school board has requested and analysis of the math and reading standaized testing scores for the district highschools. Using school and student level data an analysis was performed to show the folloing metrics:

  1. Math and reading scores by grade 
  2. Scores by schoool spending 
  3. Scores by school size
  4. schores by school type 

Additionaly, there was evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. While infomration is still being uncovered, a second analysis was perfomred with the math and reading grades for Thomas High removed. 
  

## Results 
Below we will review the results of the analysis and review how each metric was impacted by the removal of the Thomas High School 9th graders' scores being removed. 
  - The district summary: 
      - The table on the left shows the full student summary and the right is the same information without the Thomas 9th graders. The data has shifted downward slightly. While we'd expect few students to be counted, all the passing percentages moved down a few tenths of a percent. 
  - The school summary: 
      - Again with the full data set on the left and the appended on the right we can see that there is no impact to any school other than Thomas High School
  - How does Thomas stack up?
      - Even with the removed data points, Thomas High remains the second highest performing school in our analysis. While they saw a slight drop in the overall passing percent (90.9% to 90.6%) they still performed strongly. 
  - Looking even deeper at the data cuts we can see they way the Thomas High 9th graders score removal impacted other analysis. The four summary analysis below were unimpacted by the data change. While the Math and reading scores by grade showed a Nan value for Thomas 9th graders, the rest didn't change at all
      - Math and reading scores by grade
      - Scores by school spending
      - Scores by school size
      - Scores by school type
       

 
## Summary
Overall the the anlysis with and without the Thomas High School 9th graders is not drasticly different.
